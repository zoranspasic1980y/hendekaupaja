# Message to the Human kind

## Perspective
If you can imagine a world from the perspective of One (thinking like you would be all humans who existed and exists on the Earth in the same time). It's not so hard as you might say. 
Our DNA is the same, only the information in brain for each human is different but information process always work in the same way. Learning history, sociology, philosophy and psychology should help to put yourself in that position.
###
From this reference view you could see that Internet is representation of human brain as One. Every human is connected (directly or indirectly) around the world regardless of physical location. On internet our culture is global. Each culture is in the same time standing by itself and it's also part of all of us (of One).
###
Now, you might say that this is ok and that you had a feeling that this is logical and true, and so what?


## Made up truth
Let me ask you, do you trust something that you read on internet?
###
If you trusted even once, than you must say that you are picking information from internet and based on that information you are making decisions in your life.
You have picked information from global brain and changed your life according to it. We all do that. More and more we are acting in reality based on what we read on internet. That's how much this is important, powerful and serous.
###
Globalization of this kind is good, it's natural progress and as there are more and more humans living on Earth we must coordinate changes and resources to avoid slipping into chaos.
###
There is a problem with all this working as it should, but lets check one more perspective first.


## Media
Internet is created by economy, science and military. Since then it's expanded in every aspect you can imagine. 
###
Internet is also part of media. Newspapers first, radio, TV then internet.
###
Media has very important role. Media should generate information important for huge number of humans regarding real situations, and by the means of newspapers, radio, TV and Internet inform humans in area which is affected with information. 
###
What if someone could affect media and write something made up?
If you trusted the information on internet/media, then you might say that you trust in information which is made up by someone and act in real life according to that information.
###
If this is true (and it is) then we would have some made up stories which would control behavior of huge number of humans.
###
That's the world we live in now. 
###
To be honest, made up stories and manipulation started since Freud open the door for controlling basic human instincts around 60 years ago.


## Options
If we all assume that everything we read in radio, tv and internet is fake, then we will loose faith in global network, One. This would be wrong path for Us.
###
If we trust everything we read, then we could be guided by manipulated information (manipulated by someone for personal gain, money..). Also wrong.
###
Somewhere in between this two high and low limits is good place for us.
###

For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. Thats the way things work.


## Hendekaupaja is method
Hendekaupaja is method for humans to express their united message to the media that they are doing something wrong. This will create opposite force.
###
Here it how it works.
###
Internet is constructed with limits. Even with cloud systems every website has limits of possible number of visitors. Each time you read news, you opened page once. Hendekaupaja will try to open this page up to 1000 times per second.  With 1000 people that's 1.000.000 visits per second. What if there are 10.000, 100.000 of Us?
###
Hendekaupaja will slow down, shutdown and block websites.
###
Our leverage is that media will loose money because their websites are not going to work, thus marketing and services will not make profit.
###
By applying this pressure we can expect changes.
###

Since Hendekaupaja is a method it can be adapted to other aspects of internet. 
I am very worried that this method can be used for war on internet. 
One day everybody in one state could turn on Hendekaupaja on other country's websites..
I am aware that this might be opening of Pandora's box. But i must trust that we can handle it over time, nature will provide methods.

###
I might add 3 more important information to this message.
###
1. If you are looking for personal balance in order to see the global picture around you. You should look for the answer in nature. Go and watch animals, trees, birds, in day and night. Breathe. Train your monkey brain.
####
2. If you are using Hendekaupaja to create opposite force, be true to what you write when spreading the message to people who would create the force.
####
3. If you read this message and understand it, then you must help to the one's that dont understand the message, give them information to change perspectives, it's your obligation to that feeling of global connection between people (love), if you want to have it (feeling). You are not alone. Trust Us.
###

**And in the end, if you can believe in all sorts of fake stories and bullish every day, you can try believing in this on. You might like it for a change. :)**
